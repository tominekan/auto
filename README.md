A website to view and search cars

Has an admin portal for CRUD operations with cars.

Built using SvelteKit, MongoDB, TailwindCSS, and Flowbite

I custom built the authentication system 💀, but passwords are hashed using bcrypt and aren't stored on the server in plaintext so it's okay i think 👍. Also I use sessionStorage so it shouldn't be persistent.
